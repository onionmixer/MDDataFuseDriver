1. The MiniDisc System
1.1. The Featur es
With the MiniDisc, Sony has cr eated a r evolutionar y optical disc. It of fers all the featur es
that music fans have been waiting for .
Quick Random Access
The MiniDisc of fers quick random access to the music selection or phrase of your 
choice; something only a disc is capable of.
Total Durability
The MiniDisc can never str etch, br eak or tangle like cassette tapes. Since the fr ee 
floating optical pick-up never touches the sur face, scratches ar e impossible.
Superb Compactness
The MiniDisc itself is only appr oximately 64 mm in diameter , and the car tridge is 
72 x 68 x 5 mm. And because the MiniDisc is smaller , so is the MiniDisc player .
Shock-Resistant Por tability
The MiniDisc is r esistant against shocks and vibrations. New technology , using an 
advanced semiconductor memor y, provides almost total shock r esistance so ther e 
is no skipping and jitter even while jogging or driving.
Easy to Handle
The disc is pr otected in a car tridge. It is easy to handle and the ideal sound car rier for 
mobile use.
Unsurpassed Digital Sound
The MiniDisc is based on the same noiseless and distor tion-free digital r ecording 
technology as the compact disc. So whether you ar e recording your own or listening
to prerecorded music, you have the optimum in audio quality wher ever you go.
Recordable Disc
4 Track Recor ding: “A disc which r ecords” is ever y music fan’ s dream come tr ue. 
The MiniDisc of fers about 74 minutes digital r ecording on one tiny disc.

1.2. What it is and How it W orks
Two Kinds of MiniDiscs ar e Available:
Premastered MiniDiscs for 
Music Softwar e
Premastered MiniDiscs ar e used most commonly
for music and ar e sold in r ecord stor es just the
same as compact cassettes and CDs ar e.
MiniDiscs, just like CDs, ar e manufactur ed in
large volumes by high-speed injection molders,
and the music signals ar e r ecorded during r epli-
cation in the for m of pits.
Forget the times when you would wor ry about
cassette tapes becoming wor n out or wrinkled.
Moreover, the discs ar e encased in a car tridge, so
there is no wor ry about  their being scratched.
The design of the pr emastered MiniDisc car tridges
Optical Pick-up of MD Player:
is special. Pr erecorded music packages r equire a
label, featuring the ar tist’s pictur e or other infor -
mation – for it is the ar twork that most often
captures the buyer ’s eye. Ther efore the top face
of the car tridge is left completely fr ee for the
label. A window for the laser beam to r ead the
disc is only necessar y on the bottom face.
Recordable MiniDiscs
Magneto-optical (MO) technology for ms the hear t
of the r ecordable MiniDisc technology . Not only
are MO discs durable enough to withstand being
rerecorded about 1 million times, they also have a
life expectancy appr oaching that of CDs.
When r ecording the MO discs, a laser beam must
be focused onto the magnetic layer fr om behind
while a magnetic field is applied to the fr ont. For
this r eason, the car tridges for r ecordable MiniDiscs
have a r ead/write window on both sides.
The optical pick-up developed for the MD system
has the r emarkable ability to r ead both r ecorda-
ble and pr emastered MiniDiscs. For r ecordable
discs, the pick-up detects the magnetic str ucture
along the track. For  pr emastered optical discs, it
detects the geometric str ucture along the track.
The MD system is based on the design of the
standard CD pick-up with the addition of a MO
signal r eadout analyzer and two photodiodes.
During playback of r ecordable discs a 0.5mW laser
is focused onto the magnetic layer . The magnetic
signal on the disc af fects the polarization of the
reflected beam. The dir ection of polarization is
converted into light intensity by the MO signal
readout analyzer . Depending on the dir ection of
polarization one of the two photodiodes will
detect mor e light. The electrical signals fr om the
photodiodes ar e subtracted and depending on
whether the dif ference is positive or negative, a
“1” or “0” signal is r ead.

The same 0.5mW laser is used for the playback of
premastered optical discs. The amount of light
reflected depends on whether or not a pit exists
on the sur face of the disc. If ther e is no pit, a
high pr oportion of the light is r eflected back
through the beam splitter and analyzer into the
photodiodes. If a pit does exist, some of the light
is dif fracted and less light r eaches the photodi -
odes. The electrical signals fr om the photodiodes
are added up in this case and depending on the
sum, a “1” or “0” is r ead.
Overwrite Technology
In order to meet the r equirements of a compact,
lightweight, r ecordable audio system for perso -
nal use, the MD system employs a newly develo -
ped Sony magneto-optical (MO) disc that utilizes
magnetic field modulation with dir ect “over wri-
te” capability . W ith MO disc technology , the
recording of data r equires the use of a laser and
a polarizing magnetic field. When the magnetic
layer in the disc is heated by the laser to a tem -
perature above the Curie point (appr oximately
200° C), it temporarily looses its coer cive for ce.
As the disc r otates and the ir radiated domain
returns to nor mal temperatur e, its magnetic ori -
entation is deter mined by an exter nally applied
magnetic field. Polarities of “N” and “S” can
thus be r ecorded, cor responding to digital data
“1” and “0”.
Unlike conventional MO r ewrite mechanisms, the
”Sony MD over write system” positions a magne -
tic head dir ectly accr oss fr om the laser sour ce on
the opposite side of the disc. A magnetic field
corresponding to the input signal is generated
over the laser spot. The r otation of the disc then
displaces the ar ea to be r ecorded, allowing the
temperatur e at the spot to dr op back below the
Curie point. At that point, the domain takes on
the polarity of the applied magnetic field r egard-
less of the polarity that pr eviously existed. 
Overwrite Mechanism

The ease of quick random access was made possi -
ble by the development of the Compact Disc (CD).
The CD instantaneously pr ovides random access to
the beginning of any desir ed music selection. After
using a CD player , the time to r each the music sel -
ection of your choice with cassette tape players
seems extr emely cumbersome.
The MiniDisc pr ovides the same high-speed random
access for r ecordable discs as well as for pr emaste-
red discs. In addition, the r ecordable MiniDisc has a
circumferential micr ogroove or ”pr e-groove”, which
is formed when the polycarbonate substrate is injec -
tion molded. This pr e-groove is the basis for the
tracking ser vo and spindle ser vo operation during
recording or playback.
Address infor mation is r ecorded at inter vals of 13.3
milliseconds using a technology that places infinite -
simal zigzags on this pr e-groove. Ther efore, the
disc has all the addr esses already notched along the
groove even with no r ecording. The r esult is a 
stable and quick random access, as well as a variety
of optional featur es, including pr ogramming of 
the playback sequence e.g.: r earranging the
sequence of the titles r ecorded on the MD without
rerecording of the music infor mation in a matter of
seconds.
This is possible because of the “User TOC Ar ea”,
located around the inner edge of the  micr ogroove,
which only contains the or der of the music. This
system is similar to the “dir ectory management
system” of floppy discs. In other wor ds, star ting
and ending addr esses for all music tracks r ecorded
on the disc ar e stor ed in this ar ea, enabling easy
programming just by r ewriting the addr esses. This
supports also other featur es: it is possible to erase
a track out of a sequence and during playback no
gap in the r emaining music will be hear d. The era -
sed segment is allocated to the fr ee space – it is
possible to r ecord a piece of music independent of
the number of segments used.

Threshold of Hearing:
As sound level diminishes, ther e is a level below
which the human ear cannot detect. This thr es-
hold varies with fr equency. The thr eshold of
audibility is lowest for sounds with a fr equency
of appr oximately 4kHz; that is, sounds close to
this fr equency ar e most easily detected by the
ear. By analyzing the fr equency components of
an audio signal, it is possible to identify those
components that lie below the thr eshold of hea -
ring. Such components can be r emoved fr om
the original signal without af fecting per ceived
sound quality .
Masking Ef fect:
If two sounds, one loud and the other soft, ar e
produced simultaneously and they ar e close to
one another in fr equency, the softer sound be -
comes dif ficult or even impossible to hear .
Therefore, when an audio signal has a high level
component and a low level component at neigh -
bouring fr equencies, the latter can be r emoved
without af fecting per ceived sound quality .
Moreover, with incr easing overall signal amplitu -
de, it becomes possible to r emove a gr eater num -
ber of components without audible ef fect.

ATRAC Digital Audio Compression
Technology
In or der to pr ovide appr oximately 74 minutes of
music on the 2.5-inch MiniDisc, a digital audio
compression technology called “ATRAC” (Adaptive
Transform Acoustic Coding) has been newly deve -
loped. This technology compr esses infor mation
down to approximately one fifth of the amount of
data usually required. 
In 16-bit linear encoding, cur rently used in the CD
and DA T for mats, with a sampling fr equency of 
44.1 kHz, the analog signal is sampled appr oxim
ately once ever y 0.02 milliseconds. Each sample is
quantized at 16-bit r esolution into one of 65536
possible values. Ther efore, with CD and DA T, when
the analog signal is conver ted to digital data in r eal
time, 16 bits of data ar e used ever y 0.02 millise -
conds, regardless of the amplitude of the signal and
whether or not a signal is pr esent at all. 
ATRAC star ts with the same 16-bit digital data but
analyzes segments of the data for waveform content
every 11.6 msec. Based on this analysis, A TRAC
extracts and encodes only those fr equency compo -
nents that are actually audible to the human ear . 
This method of encoding is far mor e efficient than
the linear coding technique used for CD and DA T,
yet sound quality remains comparable. The following
underlying psychoacoustic principles ar e used during
this conversion.

Shock-Resistant Memor y
Conventional optical pick-up systems can easily
mistrack when subjected to shock or vibration. In
digital audio CDs, this causes “skipping” or
muting. Resistance to shock and vibration is a vir -
tual pr erequisite for tr ue por table personal audio
applications. In the MD system, Sony has solved
this pr oblem with a unique shock-r esistant
memory.
While the MD pick-up can r ead infor mation of f
the disc at a rate of 1.4Mbit per second, the
ATRAC decoder r equires a data rate of only
0.3Mbit per second for r eal time playback. This
difference in pr ocessing speed enables the use of
a readahead buf fer, placed between the pick-up
and the decoder . If a 4Mbit memor y chip is used
for the buf fer, it can stor e up to 10 seconds of
digital infor mation. Should the pick-up be jar red
out of position, the correct information continues
to be supplied to the A TRAC decoder fr om the
buffer memor y. As long as the pick-up r eturns to
the cor rect position within 10 seconds, the
listener never experiences mistracking or muting.
Since signals enter the buf fer memor y faster than
they leave it, the buf fer will eventually become
full. At that point, the MD player momentarily
stops r eading infor mation fr om the disc; it r esu-
mes reading as soon as ther e is again r oom in the
memory chip.
Using a concept called sector r epositioning, the
MD pick-up has the ability to quickly r esume rea-
ding from the cor rect point after being displaced.
When signals ar e recorded on the MiniDisc (either
recordable MO or pr emastered optical media),
address infor mation is assigned ever y 13.3 milli -
seconds. When a pick-up is shifted out of place,
the MD player quickly r ecognizes the disr uption,
identifies the wr ong address, and instantly r eturns
the pick-up to the cor rect position.

1.3. Serial Copy Management
System (SCMS)
The MD confor ms to the SCMS convention (see ISO-
958 + Amendment 84 (C . O.) 126 and 126A). The
Serial Copy Management System allows to make a
first digital copy fr om digital sour ces. Fur ther digital
copies fr om protected sour ces are prevented, copies
in the analog domain r emain possible.
1.4. Serial Copy Management
System (SCMS)
The pr emastered MD has following additional
advantages:
• The data is stor ed in physical pits and is ther efore
never erased unless it is mechanically destroyed.
• The label area is larger than the one of the record-
able MD. The entire area of one side can be used 
for labeling. The recordable MD has a shutter on 
both sides and its label is r elatively small.
• The premastered MD contains valuable character 
information (e.g. disc & track names) which will 
not be transferred during copying.
• The subdata capacity of the pr emastered MD is 
bigger. So it is possible to r ecord more character 
informationonto the MD.

MD Production
2. The pr oduction pr ocess of the pr emastered MD
2.1. MD Pr oduction
1. Input Material
DADC requires following input components from customers:
• A MD master tape or a sound car rier as for CD production (e.g. PQ-encoded U-Matic 1630).
• Print films, as well as colour pr oofs, for artwork, label- and cartridge print.
• Completely filled in form sheets (sample forms 1, 2 & 3 on pages 14, 15 & 18, form sheets in appendix).
Production can be started as soon as all necessary components have arrived.
2. Premastering
At the pr emastering studio the CD-Master tape is conver ted to a MD-Master tape. This means 
that the audio infor mation is compr essed by a For mat Converter using the A TRAC compression 
technology. Also the PQ-code is conver ted to MD specific data and optional subdata (POS*, disc 
name, track name) can be added. All infor mation then is recorded onto a MD Master.
3. Mastering
A nickel stamper for MD replication is produced in the same process as for CD. A glass plate is coated
with a thin layer of photo lacquer . A laser spot r ecords the data fr om the MD Master into the photo 
lacquer. The nickel negatives which are produced from the developed plate are used to replicate the MD.
4. Disc Replication
The r eplication pr ocess of the MD is the same as for CD. After cr eating a disc by using high 
precision molding technology, the MD is coated with a thin layer of aluminum as r eflective media, 
and subsequently with pr otective lacquer to pr otect it against damage. Then the coated discs ar e 
100% quality inspected.
5. Cartridge Assembly
As the first step in the finishing process, the cartridge is prepared with a paper label glued onto the 
front and other infor mation printed in white on the back and spine. After the clamping plate has 
been mounted onto the MD, the MD is set into the car tridge halves and the cartridge is welded.
6. Packaging
Packaging is done ver y similar to CD packaging, with a booklet and a backline car d added to the 
MD in a special MD jewel case.

1. Upper Cartridge
The upper car tridge is made of gr ey plastics (e.g. polycarbonate). Its purpose is to pr otect the MD
against mechanical damage or dust. The upper car tridge also for ms the spine on which the disc ID
information will be printed in white ink.
2. Label
The paper label is glued onto the upper car tridge.
3. Disc
The disc is manufactur ed in the same way as CDs ar e. It has a polycarbonate layer which contains
the data. A thin layer of aluminum is used as r eflective media, which is pr otected by a pr otective
layer against destruction.
4. Clamping Plate
The clamping plate is made of magnetic stainless steel. This steel plate allows to stabilize the MD
from the bottom side with a magnetic chuck. Therefore the MD does not require a hole in the upper
cartridge and so almost the complete sur face of the upper cartridge can be used for the label.
5. Shutter Lock:
It is made of plastics (e.g. POM) and locks the shutter in the close position.
6. Shutter:
The shutter is made of plastics (e.g. POM). It closes the opening in the lower cartridge through which
the data is read and it protects the MD against dust and damage.
7. Lower Cartridge:
Also the lower car tridge is made of gr ey plastics (e.g. Polycarbonate). It contains openings for the
disc-drive and the laser that r eads out the data. On the backside, infor mation like ar tist, titles, 
playing time, etc. as well as the catalogue number is printed dir ectly on the cartridge in white ink.
8. MD Jewel Case:
The MD is packaged in a 3-piece Jewel Case, consisting of clear bottom and lid parts and a grey tray.
It contains a booklet and a backline card similar as CD package. The MD Jewel case dimensions are
110 x 91 x 15 mm.

test tones, please r ecord the tones you have used
for machine adjustment at the last sound-check
of this tape.
If that is impossible as well, we will adjust to
standard reference tones.
•
Dolby: If you have used Dolby for noise r educ-
tion, your tape has to contain the appr opriate
Dolby-test-signal.
CD-WO (CD-W rite-Once)
CD-WOs have to be r ecorded without inter ruption
and in accor dance with the “Red Book”. It must
be possible to play them on standar d CD-players.
The CD-WOs must not contain uncor rectable
errors (C2 er rors). These can be caused e.g. by
damage of the   CD-WO (scratches, finger prints
etc.), by defects during r ecording (medium or
recording device) or by an inter rupted r ecording.
Disc checker print-outs (e.g. Sony CDA-5000 or
Audio Development “CD-CA TS”) should be sent
together with the CD-WO, if available. All data on
the CD-WO (audio and PQ data, ISRC code, etc.)
are transfer red 1:1 onto the manufactur ed MDs
Quality of the Sound Car rier
During pr eparation of the sound car rier, the audio
information has to be car efully sound-checked.
Please note ever y unusual noise (kind of noise and
time at which it appears) in the ”Sound & Noise
Information” (for m 2) during this sound-check. 
By pr oviding this infor mation like shown on the
sample for m sheets on the following pages a lot of
unnecessar y  delays in pr oduction can be avoided.
If a noise which is not mentioned on this infor -
mation will be found during quality inspection at
DADC, the pr oduction might be delayed.
PQ Encoding
Start r ecording appr ox. 15 sec. after T ime code
start. Please pay special attention to the of fset-
time of the begin-points. W e recommend to use
an of fset-time of at least 5 frames to avoid that
the music star t is cut of f during playback.
Definitions
• “Begin” marks the star t point of a track. It 
defines the addr ess at which the MD player
starts to playback a track.
International Standar d Recording Code
(ISRC code) and UPC/EAN code (BAR code)
A disc catalogue number by means of a UPC/EAN
code and the ISRC numbers as assigned by the
IFPI can be r ecorded on ever y MD. For this
UPC/EAN code and the ISRC numbers must be
included in the original PQ Code as supplied by
you or it must be specified in the “Pr emastering
Instructions".
Additional Specifications for 
R-DAT Tapes
